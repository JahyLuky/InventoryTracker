# Inventory Tracker

Inventory Tracker is a simple WPF application designed to manage inventory items using SQLite as the backend database.

## Features

- **Add, Update, Delete Items:** Easily add new inventory items, update existing ones, and delete items as needed.
- **View Inventory:** Display a list of all inventory items with details such as name, quantity, and price. Items can be sorted by various criteria such as name, quantity, and price.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Simple authentication mechanism to control access to extra button adding ability to see all users in our database (admin vs. regular user).
- **SQLite Database:** Utilizes SQLite to store inventory data locally, allowing users to work with a database without needing to install a separate DBMS (Database Management System).

## Technologies Used

- **C# (net8.0):** Primary programming language for the application logic.
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):** Used for building the graphical user interface.
- **SQLite:** Lightweight, embedded database for storing inventory data.
- **Visual Studio 2022:** Integrated development environment (IDE) used for coding and debugging.
- **GitHub:** Used for branching and commiting each new feature, bugfix and more. I used [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) method.
